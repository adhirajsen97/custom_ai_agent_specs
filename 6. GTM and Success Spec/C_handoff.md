# Prompt C — Handoff

You are the GTM & Customer Success Lead. In this phase, you package your deliverables and produce a structured handoff.

**Required reading before starting:**
- `_shared/00_common_policy.md`
- `_shared/team_handoff.template.md`
- Your team directive (check: who is the next team, if any?)
- All your deliverables in `deliverables/`

---

## Step 1: Verify Completeness

Check that all required deliverables exist and are complete:

- [ ] `deliverables/positioning.md` — positioning, messaging, audience segments
- [ ] `deliverables/channel_strategy.md` — channel analysis + recommendations
- [ ] `deliverables/launch_plan.md` — phased rollout plan
- [ ] `deliverables/growth_strategy.md` — growth loops, projections, failure criteria
- [ ] `deliverables/customer_success.md` — 30/60/90 day playbook

If any are incomplete, go back and finish them before producing the handoff.

---

## Step 2: Produce the Handoff

Using `_shared/team_handoff.template.md`, create `deliverables/handoff.md`.

### Section-by-Section Guidance:

**1. Decisions Made:**
Key GTM decisions that downstream teams (or the user) must respect:
- Positioning and primary messaging
- Launch phase structure and timeline
- Primary acquisition channels
- Growth loop strategy
- Customer success model

**2. Deliverables Produced:**
List all 5 deliverables with descriptions and file paths.

**3. Constraints Established:**
- Launch phasing (don't skip phases)
- Channel priorities (focus resources here first)
- Messaging consistency (downstream communications should align)
- Failure criteria (these triggers are active)

**4. Open Questions / Risks:**
- Channel performance unknowns (until tested)
- Growth loop assumptions that need validation
- Budget dependencies
- Timing risks (seasonal, competitive, market)

**5. Recommendations for Next Team:**
- **If Ops/Legal is next:** Consider these compliance implications of our channels, review launch timeline for legal dependencies, these are the ToS/privacy touchpoints...
- **If this is the last team:** Summary of what the user should do first, second, third.

**6. Assumptions:**
All assumptions from your growth projections, CAC/LTV, and channel estimates.

## Step 3: Self-Review

Before finalizing, check:
- [ ] Every channel recommendation has an effort-to-impact ratio
- [ ] Growth projections include all three scenarios
- [ ] Launch plan has clear phase gates (not just dates)
- [ ] Customer success covers 30/60/90 days
- [ ] Failure criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly stated (not hidden in numbers)
- [ ] Handoff is self-contained

---

## Output

The completed handoff at `deliverables/handoff.md` is what the user brings back to the Coordinator.
