## Step 1: Launch Plan

### Phased Rollout

**No big-bang launches.** Define at least 3 phases:

#### Alpha Phase
- **Goal:** [what you're validating]
- **User count target:** [e.g., 10-25 users]
- **Duration:** [timeframe]
- **How users get in:** [invitation, waitlist, direct outreach]
- **Success criteria:** [specific metrics to hit before moving to beta]
- **Feedback mechanism:** [how you collect feedback]
- **Rollback criteria:** [what would cause you to pause]

#### Beta Phase
- **Goal:** [what you're validating at this scale]
- **User count target:** [e.g., 50-200 users]
- **Duration:** [timeframe]
- **How users get in:** [expanded access, public waitlist, etc.]
- **Success criteria:** [metrics to hit before public launch]
- **Feedback mechanism:** [structured feedback collection]
- **Rollback criteria:** [what would cause you to pause or revert]

#### Public Launch
- **Goal:** [growth, revenue, market presence]
- **Launch channels:** [which channels from your strategy]
- **Launch day plan:** [what happens on day 1]
- **First week plan:** [what happens in week 1]
- **Success criteria at 30 days:** [specific metrics]

## Step 2: Growth Strategy

### Growth Loops

Identify at least **one sustainable growth mechanism**. For each loop:

```
Trigger → Action → Output → Amplification → (back to Trigger)
```

Example: New user → Uses product → Shares result → Friend sees it → New user

For each loop:
- How it works mechanically
- What drives it (user motivation)
- What could break it
- How to measure it
- Estimated impact

### Projections

Provide 3 scenarios for user acquisition over 90 days:

| Scenario | 30 days | 60 days | 90 days | Assumptions |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Pessimistic | [users] | [users] | [users] | [what goes wrong] |
| Base case | [users] | [users] | [users] | [reasonable assumptions] |
| Optimistic | [users] | [users] | [users] | [what goes right] |

### CAC/LTV (if applicable)

- **CAC estimate:** [cost per acquisition] — assumptions: [stated]
- **LTV estimate:** [lifetime value] — assumptions: [stated]
- **Payback period:** [when CAC is recovered]
- **Breakeven:** [when revenue covers costs]

### Failure Criteria

Define signals that should trigger action:

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| [metric] | [value] | Pivot / Pause / Kill / Investigate |

Write to `deliverables/growth_strategy.md`.

## Step 3: Customer Success Playbook

### 30/60/90 Day Plan

**Days 1-30: Onboarding & Activation**
- First-time user experience flow
- Key activation milestones (what constitutes an "activated" user?)
- Support touchpoints
- Common friction points and how to address them

**Days 31-60: Engagement & Retention**
- What keeps users coming back?
- Re-engagement tactics for lapsed users
- Feature adoption goals
- Community building (if applicable)

**Days 61-90: Expansion & Advocacy**
- Upsell / expansion opportunities (if applicable)
- Referral program design (if applicable)
- User advocacy and testimonial collection
- Feedback → product improvement loop

### Support Model
- What support channels? (email, chat, docs, community)
- Response time targets
- Escalation path
- Self-service vs. human support balance

Write to `deliverables/customer_success.md`.
